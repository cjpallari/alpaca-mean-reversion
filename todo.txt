[x] Get 1.5 standard deviations above and below
[x] if below, then buy
[x] if above, then sell
[x] fix start_time var in history.py to work with the url
[x] add actual buy/sell functionality
[x] get twitter functionality working

[x] figure out how to handle repeat buy orders
i think the way to handle repeat buy orders is to add the symbol to a list after buying, and make it so if the list
    contains that symbol it cannot be bought again until it is sold. if sold then remove symbol from the list
    *should think more about this*

[x]another option is to create a dictionary with the key being the symbol and the value being a timestamp of when it was
    purchased. create a variable called MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_BUYS and make a check to see if enough time has passed.
    ***this is probably the best solution so far***


[] eventually hook up purchase_info to a database or external file so it persists if the program ends.
    not currently a big deal

[] rethink how i want to handle target gain. currently shooting for 5% gain from buy price, potentially
    a better alternative
